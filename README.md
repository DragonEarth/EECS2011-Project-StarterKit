# EECS2011-Project-StarterKit
This repository provides the starter kit for the EECS2011A-F20: Fundamentals of Data Structures course project. 

You will create a Java package named ```eecs2011.project```. The [Solution.java](/src/eecs2011/project/Solution.java) 
class is where you implement your solutions.

There is an example in the [Sample.java](/src/eecs2011/project/Sample.java) class showing **one possible way** to read input, 
store data, and print answers using standard input and output. You are encouraged to implement your input/output/storage 
methods for better performance.

A sample input is provided by [sample_input](/sample_input).

## Questions, Guidelines, Tips, and Deliverables
Please check the project description at [the course eClass](https://eclass.yorku.ca/eclass/mod/assign/view.php?id=348653).
